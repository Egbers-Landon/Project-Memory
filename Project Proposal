Our project idea is an app that helps the user to remember whatever they repeatedly need to remember.  It will help the user to organize crucial information, that needs to be remembered more than once.  Some of this information may consist of shopping lists, packing lists, workout schedule, even finances, or meeting schedules.  The user can select what they need help remembering, and the app will give the user a format that bests suits their needs.  There will also be an “other” section that will give the user enough options to satisfy individual needs, but not too many options, to where the user feels overwhelmed.  We want to make a simple solution to an annoying problem, and we believe that we have the vision to make this goal a reality.

Our product combines the power of reminders with an innovative list system, that will give the user the ability to use a well thought out list more than once. The product can be used by anyone who needs to use any list more than one time. It is especially useful for those who see organization as a must, or have a hard time remembering crucial details. Our sponsor will help us to see how we can improve our app.

Required Features-
Multiple lists
Items on lists
Shopping list (with optional expiration dates and prices)
Reminders
GUI
Exporting lists into JSON

Stretch Goals-
Common list suggestions/templates 
Sorting list items by various methods
Automatically adds expired items to your shopping list
Calculates the amount of your shopping list based on previous data
Fancy GUI/different themes

Risks-
Our app will require a usable GUI, and none of us have any experience with GUIs in Java.
Alex has found resources needed to guide us in this regard. We are confident that we will be able to figure this out.

Our app will also need to have time based events like reminders, and none of us are confident interacting with the system clock or the Android notification system.
Landon found the API documentation and a tutorial that will be especially helpful in this regard.

Data Storage
We will store our data in the device memory but will look into google cloud storage as a stretch goal.

We will not be using any system for different users. It is assumed that different users will be using different devices. 

The feedback "- Games - how is going to design them? How are you moving the design to the app?" is confusingly worded and does not seem to apply to our project.
